# Serverless architecture hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement an end-to-end solution using a supplied sample based on Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Event Grid, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring using various components of Microsoft Azure. You can implement the hands-on lab on your own. However, it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

At the end of the hands-on-lab, you will have confidence in designing, developing, and monitoring a serverless solution that is resilient, scalable, and cost-effective.

## Overview

Contoso is rapidly expanding its toll booth management business to operate in a much larger area. As this is not their primary business, which is online payment services, they are struggling with scaling up to meet the upcoming demand to extract license plate information from many new tollbooths, using photos of vehicles uploaded to cloud storage. Currently, they have a manual process where they send batches of images to a 3rd-party who manually transcodes the license plates to CSV files that they send back to Contoso to upload to their online processing system.

They want to automate this process in a way that is cost-effective and scalable. They believe serverless is the best route for them but do not have the expertise to build the solution.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The Solution diagram is described in the text following this diagram.](../Whiteboard%20design%20session/media/preferred-solution.png 'Solution diagram')

The solution begins with vehicle photos being uploaded to an Azure Storage blobs container, as they are captured. An Event Grid subscription is created against the Blob storage create event, calling the photo processing **Azure Function** endpoint (on the side of the diagram), which in turn sends the photo to the **Cognitive Services Computer Vision API OCR** service to extract the license plate data. If processing was successful and the license plate number was returned, the function submits a new Event Grid event, along with the data, to an Event Grid topic with an event type called "savePlateData". However, if the processing was unsuccessful, the function submits an Event Grid event to the topic with an event type called "queuePlateForManualCheckup". Two separate functions are configured to trigger when new events are added to the Event Grid topic, each filtering on a specific event type, both saving the relevant data to the appropriate **Azure Cosmos DB** collection for the outcome, using the Cosmos DB output binding. A **Logic App** that runs on a 15-minute interval executes an Azure Function via its HTTP trigger, which is responsible for obtaining new license plate data from Cosmos DB and exporting it to a new CSV file saved to Blob storage. If no new license plate records are found to export, the Logic App sends an email notification to the Customer Service department via their Office 365 subscription. **Application Insights** is used to monitor all of the Azure Functions in real-time as data is being processed through the serverless architecture. This real-time monitoring allows you to observe dynamic scaling first-hand and configure alerts when certain events take place. **Azure Key Vault** is used to securely store secrets, such as connection strings and access keys. Key Vault is accessed by the Function Apps through an access policy within Key Vault, assigned to each Function App's system-assigned managed identity.

## Exercise 2: Develop and publish the photo processing and data export functions

**Duration**: 45 minutes

Use Visual Studio and its integrated Azure Functions tooling to develop and debug the functions locally, and then publish them to Azure. The starter project solution, TollBooths, contains most of the code needed. You will add in the missing code before deploying to Azure.

### Help references

|                                       |                                                                        |

| Code and test Azure Functions locally | <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local> |

### Task 12: Open the starter solution in Visual Studio

1. Navigate to `C:\ServerlessMCW\MCW-Serverless-architecture-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src\TollBooth`

2. From the **TollBooth** folder, open the Visual Studio Solution file, `TollBooth.sln`. Notice the solution contains the following projects:

   - TollBooth
   - UploadImages

   > **Note**: The UploadImages project is used for uploading a handful of car photos for testing scalability of the serverless architecture.

3. Switch to Windows explorer, navigate back to the **starter** subfolder and open the **license plates** subfolder. It contains sample license plate photos used for testing out the solution. One of the photos is guaranteed to fail OCR processing, which is meant to show how the workload is designed to handle such failures. The **copyfrom** folder is used by the UploadImages project as a basis for the 1,000 photo upload option for testing scalability.

## Task 13: Validate connectivity to Azure

1. From within the virtual machine, launch Visual Studio (select **Continue without code** link) and validate that you can log in with your Microsoft Account when prompted.

2. To validate connectivity to your Azure subscription, open **Cloud Explorer** from the **View** menu, and ensure that you can connect to your Azure subscription.

   ![In Cloud Explorer, the list of Azure subscriptions is shown. A single subscription is highlighted and expanded in the list.](media/vs-cloud-explorer.png 'Cloud Explorer')

### Task 4: Finish the ProcessImage function

There are a few components within the starter project that must be completed, marked as TODO in the code. The first set of TODO items we will address are in the ProcessImage function, the FindLicensePlateText class that calls the Computer Vision API, and finally the SendToEventGrid.cs class, which is responsible for sending processing results to the Event Grid topic you created earlier.

> **Note:** Do **NOT** update the version of any NuGet package. This solution is built to function with the NuGet package versions currently defined within. Updating these packages to newer versions could cause unexpected results.

> **Note:** Ensure the files are located under `C:\ServerlessMCW\`. If the files are located under a longer root path, such as  `C:\Users\workshop\Downloads\`, then you will encounter build issues in later steps: `The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters.`

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project (`C:\ServerlessMCW\MCW-Serverless-architecture-master\hands-on-lab\starter\TollBooth\TollBooth.sln`) using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, select **Task List**.

    ![The Visual Studio Menu displays, with View and Task List selected.](media/vs-task-list-link.png 'Visual Studio Menu')

3. There you will see a list of TODO tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

    ![A list of TODO tasks, including their description, project, file, and line number are displayed.](media/vs-task-list.png 'TODO tasks')

4. Open **ProcessImage.cs**. Notice that the Run method is decorated with the FunctionName attribute, which sets the name of the Azure Function to "ProcessImage". This is triggered by HTTP requests sent to it from the Event Grid service. You tell Event Grid that you want to get these notifications at your function's URL by creating an event subscription, which you will do in a later task, in which you subscribe to blob-created events. The function's trigger watches for new blobs being added to the images container of the storage account that was created in Exercise 1. The data passed to the function from the Event Grid notification includes the URL of the blob. That URL is in turn passed to the input binding to obtain the uploaded image from Blob storage.

5. The following code represents the completed task in ProcessImage.cs:

    ```csharp
    // **TODO 1: Set the licensePlateText value by awaiting a new FindLicensePlateText.GetLicensePlate method.**

    licensePlateText = await new FindLicensePlateText(log, _client).GetLicensePlate(licensePlateImage);
    ```

6. Open **FindLicensePlateText.cs**. This class is responsible for contacting the Computer Vision API to find and extract the license plate text from the photo, using OCR. Notice that this class also shows how you can implement a resilience pattern using [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly), an open source .NET library that helps you handle transient errors. This is useful for ensuring that you do not overload downstream services, in this case, the Computer Vision API. This will be demonstrated later on when visualizing the Function's scalability.

7. The following code represents the completed task in FindLicensePlateText.cs:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 2: Populate the below two variables with the correct AppSettings properties.
    var uriBase = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiUrl");
    var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiKey");
    ```

8. Open **SendToEventGrid.cs**. This class is responsible for sending an Event to the Event Grid topic, including the event type and license plate data. Event listeners will use the event type to filter and act on the events they need to process. Make note of the event types defined here (the first parameter passed into the Send method), as they will be used later on when creating new functions in the second Function App you provisioned earlier.

9. The following code represents the completed tasks in `SendToEventGrid.cs`:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 3: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for saving plate data.
    await Send("savePlateData", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);

    // TODO 4: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for queuing plate for manual review.
    await Send("queuePlateForManualCheckup", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);
    ```

    > **Note**: TODOs 5, 6, and 7 will be completed in later steps of the guide.

### Task 5: Publish the Function App from Visual Studio

In this task, you will publish the Function App from the starter project in Visual Studio to the existing Function App you provisioned in Azure.

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. Right-click the **TollBooth** project and select **Publish** from the context menu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the TollBooth is selected, and within its context menu, the Publish item is selected.](media/image39.png 'Solution Explorer ')

3. In the Publish window, select **Azure**, then select **Next**.

    ![In the Pick a publish target window, the Azure Functions Consumption Plan is selected in the left pane. In the right pane, the Select Existing radio button is selected and the Run from package file (recommended) checkbox is unchecked. The Create Profile button is also selected.](media/vs-publish-function.png 'Publish window')

    > **Note**: If you do not see the ability to publish to an Azure Function, you may need to update your Visual Studio instance.

4. In the App Service form, select your **Subscription**, select **Resource Group** under **View**, then expand your **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group and select the Function App whose name ends with **FunctionApp**. Finally, **uncheck the `Run from package file` option**.

5. Whatever you named the Function App when you provisioned it is fine. Just make sure it is the same one to which you applied the Application Settings in Task 1 of this exercise.

    ![In the App Service form, Resource Group displays in the View field, and in the tree-view below, the ServerlessArchitecture folder is expanded, and TollBoothFunctionApp is selected.](media/vs-publish-function2.png 'Publish window')

    > **Note**: We do not want to run from a package file, because when we deploy from GitHub later on, the build process will be skipped if the Function App is configured for a zip deployment.

6. After you select the Function App, select **Finish**.

    > **Note**: If prompted to update the functions version on Azure, select **Yes**.

7. Select **Publish** to start the process. Watch the Output window in Visual Studio as the Function App publishes. When it is finished, you should see a message that says, `========== Publish: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped ==========`.

    ![The Publish button is selected.](media/vs-publish-function3.png "Publish")

8. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

9. Open the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, then select the Azure Function App to which you just published.

10. Select **Functions** in the left-hand menu. You should see both functions you just published from the Visual Studio solution listed.

    ![In the Function Apps blade, in the left tree-view both TollBoothFunctionApp, and Functions (Read Only) are expanded. Beneath Functions (Read Only), two functions ExportLicensePlates and ProcessImage are highlighted.](media/dotnet-functions.png 'TollBoothFunctionApp blade')

11. Now we need to add an Event Grid subscription to the ProcessImage function, so the function is triggered when new images are added to blob storage. Select the **ProcessImage** function, select **Integration** on the left-hand menu, select **Event Grid Trigger (eventGridEvent)**, then select **Create Event Grid subscription**.

    ![In the TollboothFunctionApp tree-view, the ProcessImage function is selected. In the code window pane, the Add Event Grid subscription link is highlighted.](media/processimage-add-eg-sub.png 'ProcessImage function')

12. On the **Create Event Subscription** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    a. **Name**: Unique value for the App name similar to **processimagesub** (ensure the green check mark appears).

    b. **Event Schema**: Select Event Grid Schema.

    c. For **Topic Type**, select **Storage Accounts (Blob & GPv2)**.

    d. Select your **subscription** and **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group.

    e. For resource, select your recently created storage account. Enter **processimagesubtopic** into the **System Topic Name** field.

    f. Select only the **Blob Created** from the event types dropdown list.

    g. Leave Azure Function as the Endpoint Type.

13. Leave the remaining fields at their default values and select **Create**.

    ![In the Create event subscription form, the fields are set to the previously defined values.](media/processimage-eg-sub.png)

## Exercise 3: Create functions in the portal

**Duration**: 45 minutes

Create two new Azure Functions written in Node.js, using the Azure portal. These will be triggered by Event Grid and output to Azure Cosmos DB to save the results of license plate processing done by the ProcessImage function.

### Task 1: Create function to save license plate data to Azure Cosmos DB

In this task, you will create a new Node.js function triggered by Event Grid and that outputs successfully processed license plate data to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Open the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, then select the Azure Function App you created whose name ends with **Events**. If you did not use this naming convention, make sure you select the Function App that you _did not_ deploy to in the previous exercise.

3. Select **Functions** in the left-hand menu, then select **+ Add**.

    ![In the Function Apps blade, the TollBoothEvents2 application is selected. In the Overview tab, the + New function button is selected.](media/functions-new.png 'TollBoothEvents2 blade')

4. Enter **event grid** into the template search form, then select the **Azure Event Grid trigger** template.

    ![In the Template search form, event grid is typed in the search field. Below, the Event Grid trigger tile is highlighted.](media/new-function-event-grid-trigger-template.png "Template search form")

5. In the _New Function_ form, enter `SavePlateData` for the **Name**, then select **Create Function**.

    ![In the New Function form, SavePlateData is entered in the Name field and the Create button is highlighted.](media/new-function-saveplatedata.png "New Function form")

6. Select **Code + Test**, then replace the code in the new SavePlateData function with the following:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = function(context, eventGridEvent) {
        context.log(typeof eventGridEvent);
        context.log(eventGridEvent);

        context.bindings.outputDocument = {
            fileName: eventGridEvent.data['fileName'],
            licensePlateText: eventGridEvent.data['licensePlateText'],
            timeStamp: eventGridEvent.data['timeStamp'],
            exported: false
        };

        context.done();
    };
    ```

    ![The function code is displayed.](media/saveplatedata-code.png "SavePlateData Code + Test")

7. Select **Save**.

8. If you see the following error about Application Insights not being configured, ignore for now. We will add Application Insights in a later exercise.

    ![Error about App Insights not being installed.](media/app-insights-error-message.png "App Insights error")

### Task 2: Add an Event Grid subscription to the SavePlateData function

In this task, you will add an Event Grid subscription to the SavePlateData function. This will ensure that the events sent to the Event Grid topic containing the savePlateData event type are routed to this function.

1. With the SavePlateData function open, select **Integration** in the left-hand menu, select **Event Grid Trigger (eventGridEvent)**, then select **Create Event Grid subscription**.

    ![In the SavePlateData blade code window, the Add Event Grid subscription link is selected.](media/saveplatedata-add-eg-sub.png 'SavePlateData blade')

2. On the **Create Event Subscription** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    a. **Name**: Unique value for the App name similar to **saveplatedatasub** (ensure the green check mark appears).

    b. **Event Schema**: Select **Event Grid Schema**.

    c. For **Topic Type**, select **Event Grid Topics**.

    d. Select your **Subscription** and **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group.

    e. For resource, select your recently created Event Grid.

    f. For Event Types, select **Add Event Type**.

    g. Enter `savePlateData` for the new event type value. This will ensure this function is only triggered by this Event Grid type.

    h. Leave Azure Function as the Endpoint Type.

3. Leave the remaining fields at their default values and select **Create**.

    ![In the Create Event Subscription blade, fields are set to the previously defined values.](media/saveplatedata-eg-sub.png "Create Event Subscription")

### Task 3: Add an Azure Cosmos DB output to the SavePlateData function

In this task, you will add an Azure Cosmos DB output binding to the SavePlateData function, enabling it to save its data to the Processed collection.

1. Close the Edit Trigger blade if it is still open. Select **+ Add output** under `Outputs` within Integrations. In the `Create Output` blade that appears, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** binding type.

    ![The Add Output link is highlighted with an arrow pointing to the highlighted binding type in the Create Output blade.](media/function-output-binding-type.png "Create Output")

2. Scroll down in the Create Output form, then select **New** underneath to the Azure Cosmos DB account connection field.

    ![The new button is selected next to the Azure Cosmos DB account connection field.](media/image49.png 'New button')

    > **Note**: If you see a notice for "Extensions not installed", select **Install**.

    ![A message is displayed indicating the Cosmos DB Extensions are not installed. The Install link is selected.](media/cosmos-extension-install.png 'Cosmos DB Extensions not installed')

3. Select your Cosmos DB account from the list that appears.

4. Specify the following configuration options in the Azure Cosmos DB output form:

    a. For database name, type **LicensePlates**.

    b. For the collection name, type **Processed**.

    ![Under Azure Cosmos DB output the following field values display: Document parameter name, outputDocument; Collection name, Processed; Database name, LicensePlates; Azure Cosmos DB account connection, tollbooths_DOCUMENTDB.](media/saveplatedata-cosmos-integration.png 'Azure Cosmos DB output section')

5. Select **OK**.

    > **Note**: you should wait for the template dependency to install if you were prompted earlier.

### Task 4: Create function to save manual verification info to Azure Cosmos DB

In this task, you will create a new function triggered by Event Grid and outputs information about photos that need to be manually verified to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. Close the `SavePlateData` function. Select the **+ Add** button within the **Functions** blade of the Function App.

    ![In the left-hand menu next to the Functions item, the + button is highlighted along with its tooltip Create new displaying.](media/new-function-button.png "Create new function")

2. Enter **event grid** into the template search form, then select the **Azure Event Grid trigger** template.

    ![Event grid is entered into the search field, and in the results, Azure Event Grid trigger tile displays.](media/new-function-event-grid-trigger-template.png 'Event grid trigger')

3. In the **New Function** form, fill out the following properties:

    a. For name, type **QueuePlateForManualCheckup**

    ![In the Azure Event Grid trigger form, QueuePlateForManualCheckup is typed in the Name field along with a Create and Cancel button.](media/image51.png 'Event Grid trigger, New Function form')

4. Select **Create Function**.

5. Select **Code + Test**, then replace the code in the new QueuePlateForManualCheckup function with the following:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = async function(context, eventGridEvent) {
        context.log(typeof eventGridEvent);
        context.log(eventGridEvent);

        context.bindings.outputDocument = {
            fileName: eventGridEvent.data['fileName'],
            licensePlateText: '',
            timeStamp: eventGridEvent.data['timeStamp'],
            resolved: false
        };

        context.done();
    };
    ```

6. Select **Save**.

7. If you see the following error about Application Insights not being configured, ignore for now. We will add Application Insights in a later exercise.

    ![Error about App Insights not being installed.](media/app-insights-error-message.png "App Insights error")

### Task 5: Add an Event Grid subscription to the QueuePlateForManualCheckup function

In this task, you will add an Event Grid subscription to the QueuePlateForManualCheckup function. This will ensure that the events sent to the Event Grid topic containing the queuePlateForManualCheckup event type are routed to this function.

1. With the QueuePlateForManualCheckup function open, select **Integration** in the left-hand menu, select **Event Grid Trigger (eventGridEvent)**, then select **Create Event Grid subscription**.

    ![In the QueuePlateForManualCheckup Integration blade, the Create Event Grid subscription link is selected.](media/queueplateformanualcheckup-add-eg-sub.png "QueuePlateForManualCheckup blade")

2. On the **Create Event Subscription** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    a. **Name**: Unique value for the App name similar to **queueplateformanualcheckupsub** (ensure the green check mark appears).

    b. **Event Schema**: Select **Event Grid Schema**.

    c. For **Topic Type**, select **Event Grid Topics**.

    d. Select your **Subscription** and **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group.

    e. For resource, select your recently created Event Grid.

    f. For Event Types, select **Add Event Type**.

    g. Enter `queuePlateForManualCheckup` for the new event type value. This will ensure this function is only triggered by this Event Grid type.

    h. Leave Azure Function as the Endpoint Type.

3. Leave the remaining fields at their default values and select **Create**.

    ![In the Create Event Subscription blade, fields are set to the previously defined values.](media/manualcheckup-eg-sub.png)

### Task 6: Add an Azure Cosmos DB output to the QueuePlateForManualCheckup function

In this task, you will add an Azure Cosmos DB output binding to the QueuePlateForManualCheckup function, enabling it to save its data to the NeedsManualReview collection.

1. Close the Edit Trigger blade if it is still open. Select **+ Add output** under `Outputs` within Integrations. In the `Create Output` blade that appears, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** binding type.

    ![The Add Output link is highlighted with an arrow pointing to the highlighted binding type in the Create Output blade.](media/function-output-binding-type.png "Create Output")

2. Specify the following configuration options in the Azure Cosmos DB output form:

    a. For database name, enter **LicensePlates**.

    b. For collection name, enter **NeedsManualReview**.

    c. Select the **Azure Cosmos DB account connection** you created earlier.

    ![In the Azure Cosmos DB output form, the following field values display: Document parameter name, outputDocument; Collection name, NeedsManualReview; Database name, LicensePlates; Azure Cosmos DB account connection, tollbooths_DOCUMENTDB.](media/manualcheckup-cosmos-integration.png 'Azure Cosmos DB output form')

3. Select **OK**.

## Exercise 4: Monitor your functions with Application Insights

**Duration**: 15 minutes

Application Insights can be integrated with Azure Function Apps to provide robust monitoring for your functions. In this exercise, you will view telemetry in the Application Insights account that you created when provisioning the Function Apps. Since you assigned the Application Insights account to the Function Apps when creating them, the Application Insights telemetry key was added to the Function App configuration for you.

| Live Metrics Stream: Monitor & Diagnose with 1-second latency | <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-live-stream> |

### Task 1: Use the Live Metrics Stream to monitor functions in real time

1. Open the **TollboothMonitor** Application Insights instance from within your lab resource group.

    ![The Application Insights instance is highlighted in the resource group.](media/resource-group-application-insights.png "Application Insights")

2. In Application Insights, select **Live Metrics Stream** underneath Investigate in the menu.

    ![In the TollBoothMonitor blade, in the pane under Investigate, Live Metrics Stream is selected. ](media/live-metrics-link.png 'TollBoothMonitor blade')

3. Leave the Live Metrics Stream open and go back to the starter app solution in Visual Studio.

4. Navigate to the **UploadImages** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio. Right-click on **UploadImages**, then select **Properties**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the UploadImages project is expanded, and Properties is selected from the right-click context menu.](media/vs-uploadimages.png 'Solution Explorer')

5. Select **Debug** in the left-hand menu, then paste the connection string for your Blob storage account into the **Command line arguments** text field. This will ensure that the required connection string is added as an argument each time you run the application. Additionally, the combination of adding the value here and the `.gitignore` file included in the project directory will prevent the sensitive connection string from being added to your source code repository in a later step.

    ![The Debug menu item and the command line arguments text field are highlighted.](media/vs-command-line-arguments.png "Properties - Debug")

6. Save your changes.

7. Right-click the **UploadImages** project in the Solution Explorer, then select **Debug** then **Start new instance** from the context menu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the UploadImages project is selected. From the context menu, Debug then Start new instance is selected.](media/vs-debug-uploadimages.png 'Solution Explorer')

    >**Note:** Ensure the files are located under `C:\ServerlessMCW\`. If the files are located under a longer root path, such as `C:\Users\workshop\Downloads\`, then you will encounter build issues in later steps: `The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters.`

8. When the console window appears, enter **1** and press **ENTER**. This uploads a handful of car photos to the images container of your Blob storage account.

    ![A Command prompt window displays, showing images being uploaded.](media/image69.png 'Command prompt window')

9. Switch back to your browser window with the Live Metrics Stream still open within Application Insights. You should start seeing new telemetry arrive, showing the number of servers online, the incoming request rate, CPU process amount, etc. You can select some of the sample telemetry in the list to the side to view output data.

    ![The Live Metrics Stream window displays information for the two online servers. Displaying line and point graphs including incoming requests, outgoing requests, and overall health. To the side is a list of Sample Telemetry information. ](media/image70.png 'Live Metrics Stream window')

10. Leave the Live Metrics Stream window open once again, and close the console window for the image upload. Debug the UploadImages project again, then enter **2** and press **ENTER**. This will upload 1,000 new photos.

    ![The Command prompt window displays with image uploading information.](media/image71.png 'Command prompt window')

11. Switch back to the Live Metrics Stream window and observe the activity as the photos are uploaded. You can see the number of servers online, which translate to the number of Function App instances that are running between both Function Apps. You should also notice things such as a steady cadence for the Request Rate monitor, the Request Duration hovering below \~200ms second, and the Incoming Requests roughly matching the Outgoing Requests.

    ![In the Live Metrics Stream window, two servers are online. Under Incoming Requests. the Request Rate heartbeat line graph is selected, as is the Request Duration dot graph. Under Overall Health, the Process CPU heartbeat line graph is also selected, the similarities between this graph and the Request Rate graph under Incoming Requests are highlighted for comparison.](media/image72.png 'Live Metrics Stream window')

12. After this has run for a while, close the image upload console window once again, but leave the Live Metrics Stream window open.

### Task 2: Observe your functions dynamically scaling when resource-constrained

In this task, you will change the Computer Vision API to the Free tier. This will limit the number of requests to the OCR service to 10 per minute. Once changed, run the UploadImages console app to upload 1,000 images again. The resiliency policy programmed into the FindLicensePlateText.MakeOCRRequest method of the ProcessImage function will begin exponentially backing off requests to the Computer Vision API, allowing it to recover and lift the rate limit. This intentional delay will greatly increase the function's response time, thus causing the Consumption plan's dynamic scaling to kick in, allocating several more servers. You will watch all of this happen in real time using the Live Metrics Stream view.

1. Open your Computer Vision API service by opening the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, and then selecting the **Cognitive Services** service name.

2. Select **Pricing tier** under Resource Management in the menu. Select the **F0 Free** pricing tier, then choose **Select**.

    > **Note**: If you already have an **F0** free pricing tier instance, you will not be able to create another one.

    ![In the Cognitive Services blade, under Resource Management, the Pricing tier item is selected. In the Choose your pricing tier blade, the F0 Free option is selected.](media/image73.png 'Choose your pricing tier blade')

3. Switch to Visual Studio, debug the **UploadImages** project again, then enter **2** and press **ENTER**. This will upload 1,000 new photos.

    ![The Command prompt window displays image uploading information.](media/image71.png 'Command Prompt window')

4. Switch back to the Live Metrics Stream window and observe the activity as the photos are uploaded. After running for a couple of minutes, you should start to notice a few things. The Request Duration will start to increase over time. As this happens, you should notice more servers being brought online. Each time a server is brought online, you should see a message in the Sample Telemetry stating that it is "Generating 2 job function(s)", followed by a Starting Host message. You should also see messages logged by the resilience policy that the Computer Vision API server is throttling the requests. This is known by the response codes sent back from the service (429). A sample message is "Computer Vision API server is throttling our requests. Automatically delaying for 16000ms".

    > **Note**: If you select a sample telemetry and cannot see its details, drag the resize bar at the bottom of the list up to resize the details pane.

    ![In the Live Metrics Stream window, 11 servers are now online.](media/image74.png 'Live Metrics Stream window')

5. After this has run for some time, close the UploadImages console to stop uploading photos.

6. Navigate back to the **Computer Vision** API and set the pricing tier back to **S1 Standard**.

## Exercise 5: Explore your data in Azure Cosmos DB

**Duration**: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will use the Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer in the portal to view saved license plate data.

5. Expand the **NeedsManualReview** collection, then select **Items**.

6. Select one of the documents to view its contents. Notice that the filename is provided, as well as a property named "resolved". While this is out of scope for this lab, those properties can be used together to provide a manual process for viewing the photo and entering the license plate.

    ![In the tree-view beneath the LicensePlates Cosmos DB, the NeedsManualReview collection is expanded, and the Items item is selected. On the Items tab, a document is selected, and to the side, the JSON properties of the document are displayed. The first four properties of the document (fileName, licencePlateText, timeStamp, and resolved) are shown along with the standard Cosmos DB properties.](media/data-explorer-needsreview.png 'Tollbooth - Data Explorer blade')

7. Select the ellipses (...) next to the **Processed** collection and select **New SQL Query**.

    ![In the tree-view beneath the LicencePlates Cosmos DB, the Processed collection is selected. From its right-click context menu, New SQL Query is selected.](media/data-explorer-new-sql-query.png 'Tollbooth - Data Explorer blade')

8. Modify the SQL query to count the number of processed documents that have not been exported:

    ```sql
    SELECT VALUE COUNT(1) FROM c WHERE c.exported = false
    ```

9. Execute the query and observe the results. In our case, we have 669 processed documents that need to be exported.

    ![In the Query window, the previously defined SQL query displays. Under Results, the number 669 is highlighted.](media/cosmos-query-results.png 'Query 1 tab')

## Exercise 6: Create the data export workflow

**Duration**: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you create a new Logic App for your data export workflow. This Logic App will execute periodically and call your ExportLicensePlates function, then conditionally send an email if there were no records to export.

### Task 3: Finish your ExportLicensePlates function code and push changes to GitHub to trigger deployment

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, select **Task List**.

    ![Task List is selected from the Visual Studio View menu.](media/image37.png 'Visual Studio View menu')

3. There you will see a list of TODO tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

4. Open **DatabaseMethods.cs**.

5. The following code represents the completed task in DatabaseMethods.cs:

    ```csharp
        // TODO 5: Retrieve a List of LicensePlateDataDocument objects from the collectionLink where the exported value is false.
        licensePlates = _client.CreateDocumentQuery<LicensePlateDataDocument>(collectionLink,
                new FeedOptions() { EnableCrossPartitionQuery=true,MaxItemCount = 100 })
            .Where(l => l.exported == false)
            .ToList();
        // TODO 6: Remove the line below.
    ```

6. Make sure that you deleted the following line under TODO 6: `licensePlates = new List<LicensePlateDataDocument>();`.

7. Save your changes then open **FileMethods.cs**.

8. The following code represents the completed task in DatabaseMethods.cs:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 7: Asyncronously upload the blob from the memory stream.
    await blob.UploadFromStreamAsync(stream);
    ```

9. Save your changes.

10. Click the **Git** menu in Visual Studio, then select **Commit or Stash...**.

    ![The Git menu is displayed.](media/vs-commit-or-stash.png "Commit or Stash")

11. Enter a commit message, then select **Commit All**.

    ![In the Team Explorer - Changes window, "Finished the ExportLicensePlates function" displays in the message box, and the Commit All button is selected.](media/vs-git-commit-all.png 'Team Explorer - Changes window')

12. After committing, select the **Push** button to push your changes to the GitHub repo.

    ![The Push button is highlighted.](media/vs-git-push.png "Push changes")

    Afterward, you should see a message stating that you successfully pushed your changes to the GitHub repository.

    ![The message is displayed.](media/vs-git-push-success.png "Successfully pushed")

13. Go back to Deployment Center for your Function App in the portal. You should see an entry for the deployment kicked off by this last commit. Check the timestamp on the message to verify that you are looking at the latest one. **Make sure the deployment completes before continuing**.

## Exercise 8: Rerun the workflow and verify data export

**Duration**: 10 minutes

With the latest code changes in place, run your Logic App and verify that the files are successfully exported.

### Task 1: Run the Logic App

1. Open your ServerlessArchitecture resource group in the Azure portal, then select your Logic App.

2. From the **Overview** blade, select **Enable**.

    ![In the TollBoothLogic Logic app blade, Overview is selected in the left menu, and the Enable enable button is selected in the right pane.](media/image113.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

3. Now select **Run Trigger**, then select **Recurrence** to immediately execute your workflow.

    ![In the TollBoothLogic Logic app blade, Run Trigger and Recurrence are selected.](media/image114.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

4. Select the **Refresh** button next to the Run Trigger button to refresh your run history. Select the latest run history item. If the expression result for the condition is **true**, then that means the CSV file should've been exported to Blob storage. Be sure to disable the Logic App so it doesn't keep sending you emails every 15 minutes. Please note that it may take longer than expected to start running, in some cases.

    ![In Logic App Designer, in the Condition section, under Inputs, true is highlighted.](media/image115.png 'Logic App Designer ')

### Task 2: View the exported CSV file

1. Open your ServerlessArchitecture resource group in the Azure portal, then select your **Storage account** you had provisioned to store uploaded photos and exported CSV files.

2. In the Overview pane of your storage account, select **Containers**.

    ![In the Overview blade, Containers is selected.](media/storage-containers.png 'Services section')

3. Select the **export** container.

    ![Export is selected under Name.](media/image117.png 'Export option')

4. You should see at least one recently uploaded CSV file. Select the filename to view its properties.

    ![In the Export blade, under Name, a .csv file is selected.](media/blob-export.png 'Export blade')

5. Select **Download** in the blob properties window.

    ![In the Blob properties blade, the Download button is selected.](media/blob-download.png 'Blob properties blade')

    The CSV file should look similar to the following:

    ![A CSV file displays with the following columns: FileName, LicensePlateText, TimeStamp, and LicensePlateFound.](media/csv.png 'CSV file')

6. The ExportLicensePlates function updates all of the records it exported by setting the exported value to true. This makes sure that only new records since the last export are included in the next one. Verify this by re-executing the script in Azure Cosmos DB that counts the number of documents in the Processed collection where exported is false. It should return 0 unless you've subsequently uploaded new photos.

## After the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 10 minutes

In this exercise, attendees will deprovision any Azure resources that were created in support of the lab.

### Task 1: Delete the resource group in which you placed your Azure resources

1. From the Portal, navigate to the blade of your **Resource Group** and select **Delete** in the command bar at the top.

2. Confirm the deletion by re-typing the **resource group name** and selecting **Delete**.

3. If you created a different resource group for your virtual machined, be sure to delete that as well.

4. Optionally, delete the GitHub repository you created for this lab by selecting **settings** and then **Delete this repository** from the GitHub website.

### Task 2: Delete the GitHub repo

1. Open <https://www.github.com>, then select your profile icon and select **Your repositories**.

2. Navigate to your repo and select it.

3. Select the **Settings** tab, scroll to the bottom, select **Delete this repository**.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
